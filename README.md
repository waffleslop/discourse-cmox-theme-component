# Feverbee Engagement Theme

This is the [experts.feverbeee.com](https://experts.feverbee.com/)
theme that was graciously made available by Richard Millington as
described in
[this topic](https://experts.feverbee.com/t/code-template-of-feverbees-interactive-banner/9478/5?u=jay_pfaffman).
Jay Pfaffman downloaded the theme, removed Feverbee-specific elements
and published it here.

This theme is intended as a starting point only. Before using this
theme you will need to make modifications to customize it for use on
your site. Have a look at [How to add a featured topic list to your Discourse Homepage](https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-to-add-a-featured-topic-list-to-your-discourse-homepage/132949) for some more information.
